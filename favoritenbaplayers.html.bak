	<h1>My Favorite NBA Players Growing Up</h1>
	
	<h2>Derrick Rose<h2>
	<p> As a Chicago native, I was and still am a die hard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose"><strong>Derrick Rose</strong></a>fan. I followed Rose's journey from when he was in highschool
	at Simeon Career Academy watching highlight mixtapes on Youtube. After highschool, I watched him play a year in college at The University of Memphis in which after he entered the NBA draft and was selected
	as the Number 1 pick of the 2008 draft by the Chicago Bulls. As far as I could tell, bringing a #1 pick who was a Chicago native to the Bulls franchise was an exciting thing to say the least. As a basketball 
	fan growing up, watching D. Rose's explosiveness and agility was always exhilarating. The Bulls after the Jordan era wasn't doing too well and Derrick Rose gave the team new found hope after he decided to do
	his thing and become the league's youngest MVP at 22 years old in his 3rd season. In that same MVP year, Rose led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference Finals, in which they have not been there in years. 
	Unfortunately, they had lost to the Miami Heat led by Lebron James. This was as far Rose had gotten in the playoffs before he tragically tore his ACL the following year in the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers. 
	After recovering the following years, he has bounced from team to team but has worked on body recovery tremedously and has found a solid role on his current team of the New York Knicks.</p>

	<h2>Dwayne Wade<h2>
	<p> Around the same time I started watching Derrick Rose, I quickly became a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade"><strong>Dwayne Wade</strong></a> who also is a Chicago native but was drafted 
	5th overall in 2006 by the Miami Heat. Dwayne Wade, nicknamed the "Flash" was a shifty and dominant shooting guard who won his first NBA championship in 2006 with the Miami Heat. However, I was only 6 at that time
	so the Dwayne Wade I grew up admiring was the 2008 and on version. After beating Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat had advacned to the Finals where they lost 4-2 to 
	the Dallas Mavericks. After the 2011 defeat to the Mavs, Dwayne Wade and the Heat went on to win back to back championships with the help of LeBron James and Chris Bosh in 2012 and 2013. After countless All-Star
	appearances, Dwayne Wade retired as one of the greatest to do it and a Miami Heat legend in 2019.</p>
